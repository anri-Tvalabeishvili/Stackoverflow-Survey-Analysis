## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data to better understand:

1. What are the distributions of women with respect to country, ethnicity, level of education, etc.
2. What are the most popular types of development/languages.
4. What factors associate with high salary, eg. type of development, education level, etc.?
5. People with what skills earn more?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Each `ipynb` file processes specific year data. <br/>
Each step of the code is given in the form of comments (in English)
#### Each file contains 3 large sections, namely:
- `import some Required libraries and data` In this section we will import the libraries and data to be used in the future. 

- `Create functions for data processing` In this section we will create the functions which help us to calculate data and create Bar Chart. 

- `Data processing with a certain classification` This section deals directly with data processing
