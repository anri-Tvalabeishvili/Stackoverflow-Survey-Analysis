Each `ipynb` file processes specific year data.

#### Each file contains 3 large sections, namely:
- `import some Required libraries and data` In this section we will import the libraries and data to be used in the future. 

- `Create functions for data processing` In this section we will create the functions which help us to calculate data and create Bar Chart.
